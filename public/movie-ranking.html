 <hr />
 <h3>She's the man</h3>
 <p>This movie is not only my favorite,but also my siblings as well. This is funny and has a good story plot. 
    We memorized every line in this movie.We watched it for several times already. This is about a girl who pretended to be her brother and goes to the school her brother goes to, in order to join the school's soccer team.</p>
 <h3>Freaky Friday</h3>
 <p>A famous movie in the early 2000s. This is a good movie to watch with your family. 
    The characters are great as well. There's a continuation of this movie this year.</p>
 <h3>The Devil Wear's Prada</h3>
 <p>It's about a woman who applied for a job that is far from what she aims to. She unexpectedly got hired in a fashion editorial company lead by a diabolical editor, Miranda Priestly.
     Watch how Andy strives to become her best assistant. Another movie with a sequel.</p>
